scalejs
=======

Develop scalable JavaScript client side applications in Visual Studio.

The framework is targeted towards a .Net developer who has experience with Silverlight or WPF 
and is looking for ways to apply same principles and patterns 
(e.g. MVVM, bindings, modularization, templated controls, reactive programming, etc.)
to JavaScript client side development. 

It's inspired by Nicholas Zakas <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXjVFPosQHw">"Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture"</a> talk. 
The framework leverages best libraries such as Knockout, Linq, RxJS, etc. and relies on what's considered as "good parts" of JavaScript language.
